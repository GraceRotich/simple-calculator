    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, you'll create a simple calculator which can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division depending on the user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "* Use a while loop\n",
    "* Incorporate input/output functionality in code to allow for user interaction\n",
    "* Declare and use a function with arguments\n",
    "* Use break and continue to add control flow to a while loop\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "* User chooses the desired operation. Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are valid options for operations\n",
    "* Two numbers are taken and an if…elif…else branching is used to execute a particular section\n",
    "* Using functions add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() evaluate respective operations\n",
    "* The code should handle exceptions and must return \"invalid input\" when an unexpected character is given in the input (anything other than 1 - 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example interface\n",
